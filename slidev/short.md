# Rust's Recursive Functions

Recursive functions call themselves to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.

Imagine a function that needs to find all the subfeatures of a feature in a hierarchical structure. 
We could use a recursive function to traverse the structure, calling itself for each child feature until it reaches the end.

Recursive functions transform complex problems into simpler ones. 
They can make your code more elegant and concise, but it's important to use them wisely to avoid infinite loops.
